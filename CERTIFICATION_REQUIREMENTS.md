## 📝 Accepted Project Types

### General Options

1. **Custom application** with business logic
2. **Own version of 10xCards** (AI-powered flashcard generation app - example project from Module 2)
3. **Extension of existing project** with a new module

### For 1st Edition Participants in 2nd Edition

Choose one:
- New project from scratch
- Extension of existing project with new module/feature

---

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack

- **Any stack allowed** - doesn't have to be JavaScript/web-based
- **Application types**: web, desktop, mobile, embedded
- **Key criterion**: Use of AI in development process, NOT application complexity

### Repository Configuration

#### Public Repository
- Not required, but **welcome**

#### Private Repository
- Acceptable
- **Must add** `@przeprogramowani` as collaborator

## 📚 Course Approach & Best Practices

### Working with Materials

✅ **DO:**
- Start working on the project from **Module 2** (workflow from idea to implementation)
- Go through lessons in order, but work on project asynchronously
- Watch full lessons for context understanding
- Adapt workflow to your experience level
- First watch materials, then build at your own pace

### Course Pace

| Phase | Intensity | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Prework & Module 1** | Lighter | Warmup, familiarization with tools and AI techniques |
| **Modules 2-3** | **Intensive** | **80% of project work** - full process from idea to implementation |
| **Modules 3-4** | Lighter | Knowledge pills without additional assignments |

**Don't stress about the pace** - you have three deadlines available

---

## 🤖 Effective Work with AI

### Best Practices

1. **Prepare project artifacts**
   - PRD
   - Technical specifications
   - Implementation plans

2. **Steer AI work**
   - Don't hand over complete control
   - Guide the process

3. **Verify results**
   - Vibe coding only works for experiments
   - Always validate AI output

### Recommended Tools

#### For VS Code Ecosystem
1. **Cursor** (primary)
2. Windsurf or alternatives
3. Copilot (worst case)

#### For JetBrains Ecosystem
1. **Claude Code** in terminal
2. Windsurf/Cline as plugin
3. Copilot (backup)

#### IDE-Independent
- **Claude Code** or **Codex CLI** as default for everything

## 🎯 Certificate Philosophy

### Your Mindset & Ours

| Aspect | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| **AI Usage** | Not verified - project is for yourself |
| **App Complexity** | Not evaluated - meeting requirements is what counts |
| **Success Key** | Quality of project artifacts = key to success with AI |
| **Workflow** | Your own workflow > 1:1 copying materials |
